# Hubble adaptor for OpenTelemetry - Developer Documentation

## About the Project

This project aims to enable exporting Hubble flow data using OpenTelemetry collector. It currently
supports log and trace data formats. It maps every flow to a log or a span. Trace IDs are generated
automatically for related flows, based on source/destination address, port and Cilium identity.
When an L7 flow contains common trace ID headers, those will be respected.

The functionality is package as a standalone program (see [`main.go`](main.go)) that can speak Hubble
API as well as OTLP, as well as an reciever for OpenTelemetry collector (see [`receiver/`](receiver)).
Eventually it might prove that custom OpenTelemetry collector is the most suitable way of running the
Hubble adaptor, but at the time of writing prior to the initial realese it wasn't abundantly clear.

## Getting Started

First, one should install some of the key tools for development. Be sure you have latest version
of Go installed and know your `GOPATH`.

```
(cd tools ; go install github.com/cilium/mock-hubble go.opentelemetry.io/collector/cmd/builder)
```

## Building Custom OpenTelemetry Collector

OpenTelemetry enables vendors to build custom collector binaries with their own plugins included.
For the purpose of testing logs exporters, and to enable exporting to various trace export from
a single collector build, there is a custom collector builder config in [`images/otelcol/builder.yaml`](images/otelcol/builder.yaml).

A custom collector is needed for testing all different exporters. There is a containerised build in
[`images/otelcol/Dockerfile`](images/otelcol/Dockerfile), but it's a bit easier to just run the collector
locally, especially as it's not OS-specific at all.

```
./dev-scripts/build-otelcol.sh
```

The collector needs to be re-built whenever changes to `images/otelcol/builder.yaml` are made.

## Running Custom OpenTelemetry Collector

```
./dev-scripts/run-otelcol.sh
```

This will run a collector with a config featuring AWS XRay & CloudWatch exporters. An any other
config can used by passing `--config <path>` to the script.

This script doesn't do anything special, it's just a little bit convenient. Alternatively one
can just invoke the collector this way:

```
./dev-scripts/otelcol-hubble/otelcol-hubble  --config ./dev-scripts/export-aws.yaml
```

To run the collector with a config that reads flows from Hubble directly and writes to AWS:
```
./dev-scripts/run-otelcol.sh --config dev-scripts/hubble-export-aws.yaml
```

## Running Mock Hubble

For development, it's easier to run [a mock version of Hubble API](https://github.com/cilium/mock-hubble)
instead that produces a predictable stream of flows.

```
./dev-scripts/run-mock-hubble.sh
```

This script will run `mock-hubble` with a set of sample flows from `testdata` directory. It will replay the flows
as 10x the rate stored in the sample file. The sample file simply contains output of `hubble observe -o json -f`
and can be updated easily.

##Â Running `hubble-otel` (standalone)

To start Hubble adaptor in stanalone mode against a local collector, run:

```
./dev-script/run-hubble-otel.sh [<flags>]
```

This script is also only for convenience.
